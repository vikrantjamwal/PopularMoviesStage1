Popular Movies Stage 1
====

### Project Overview
In this project, weâ€™ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

This app will:

* Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
* Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
  * The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
* Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  * original title
  * movie poster image thumbnail
  * a plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  * user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  * release date
